<p>
I am a PhD student at <a href = "https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/icj/">Institut Camille Jordan</a>, supervised by <a href = "https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~begnac/">Ita√Ø Ben Yaacov</a>. 
</p>

<p>
My main interest is to study the model theory of globally valued fields, for which a detailed introduction can be found in <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04570">this paper</a>.
These are fields equipped with functions called <it>heights</it>, which generalise the notion of Weil heights over global fields.
Globally valued fields are analogous to adelic curves, but can be studied as structures in first-order continuous logic.
