I am a PhD student at <a href = "https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/icj/">Institut Camille Jordan</a>, supervised by <a href = "https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~begnac/">Ita√Ø Ben Yaacov</a>. 
My main interest is to study the model theory of globally valued fields, for which a detailed introduction can be found in <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04570">this paper</a>.
